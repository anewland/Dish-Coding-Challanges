`challenge title:` Slot Machine 2.0<br>

## 1. Slot Machine 2.0
A slot machine has multiple wheels that are spun `n` times. In each spin, each wheel may have multiple stops from 1 to 9 and shows one random number on the machine's dashboard.

Given the number of spins `n`, determine the minimum number of stops on each wheel to produce the numbers displayed on the dashboard for each spin. Then, calculate the total stops.

### Example
<pre>n = 4
spins[] = ['712', '246', '365', '312']</pre>

the spins on a slot machine with `3` wheels are recorded as an array, history:
<pre>
  7 1 2
  2 4 6
  3 6 5
  3 1 2
</pre>

One wheel needs to have at least `7` stops to produce the numbers displayed on the dashboard for `1st` spin. Since `7` is the highest value in any row, remove the highest value from each of the rows:

<pre>
  1 2
  2 4
  3 5
  1 2
</pre>

Now the highest value is `5` so another wheel much have `5` stops to produce the numbers displayed on the dahsboard for `3rd` spin. Using the same logic, the final wheel needs `3` stops. Total stops are `7 + 5 + 3 = 15`.

### Function Description
Compplete the function `slotSpins` in the editor below.

slotWheels has the following parameter(s): <br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; _string spins [n]:_ an array of equal length strings of digits spun <br>
Returns: <br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; _int:_ an integer that represents the sum of the minimum number of stops on all of the wheels.

### Constraints
- _1 ≤ |spins| ≤ 50_
- _1 ≤ spins[i] ≤ 50_
- All _spins[i]_ in a test case will be of equal length.
- All characters in each _spins[i] ∈ [0-9]_

## + Input Format for Custom Testing
Input from stdin will be processed as follows and passed to the function.

The firtst line contains an integer `n`, the size of the array `history`. Each of the next `n` lines contains a string `spins[i]` where `0 ≤ i < n`.

## + Sample Case 0
### Sample Input 0
<pre>
STDIN     Function Parameters
-----     -------------------
4      →  spins[] Size n = 4
137    →  spins[] = ['137', '364', '115', '724']
364
115
724
</pre>

### Sample Output 0
<pre>14</pre>

### Explanation 0
the spins on a slot machine with `4` wheels are recorded as an array, `spins`:
<pre>
  1 3 7
  3 6 4
  1 1 5
  7 2 4
</pre>
One wheel need to have at least `7` stops to produce the numbers displayed on the dashboard for `1st` spin and `4th` spin. Since `7` is the highest value in any row, remove the highest value from each of the rows:
<pre>
  1 3
  3 4
  1 1
  2 4
</pre>
One wheel need to have at least `4` stops to produce the numbers displayed on the dashboard for `2nd` spin and `4th` spin. Since `4` in the highest value in any row, remove the highest value from each of the rows. Using the same logic, the final wheel needs `3` stops. total stopsare `7 + 4 + 3 = 14`.

## + Sample Case 1
### Sample Input 1
<pre>
STDIN     Function Parameters
-----     -------------------
4      →  spins[] Size n = 4
1112   →  spins[] = ['1112', '1111', '1211', '1111']
1111
1211
1111
</pre>

### Sample Output 1
<pre>5</pre>

### Explanation 1
the spins on a slot machine with `4` wheels are recorded as an array, `spins`:
<pre>
  1 1 1 2
  1 1 1 1
  1 2 1 1
  1 1 1 1
</pre>
One wheel need to have at least `2` stops to produce the numbers displayed on the dashboard for `1st` spin and `3rd` spin. Since `2` is the highest value in any row, remove the highest value from each of the rows:
<pre>
  1 1 1
  1 1 1
  1 1 1
  1 1 1
</pre>
Using the same logic, 3 wheels need to have 1 stop each. Total stops are `2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`.
